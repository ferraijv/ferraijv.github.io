This is the blog of Jacob Ferraiolo. I write about markets, economics, random coding projects, books, and anything else that interests me at the time. This blog is a structured attempt to continue learning, connect with like-minded people, and structure my thoughts. I don't pretend to have much new to say. I write more to learn and express myself than I do to impart knowledge to others.
