In Geopolitical Alpha, Papic lays out his framework for predicting geopolitical events. He calls this 
a constraint-based framework. He argues that investment professionals
rarely pay much attention to geopolitical events, and when they do, their opinions
closely align with the media-driven narrative. This media-driven narrative generally
focuses on individual actors' preferences. In other words, Boris Johson states that "he'd
"rather be dead in a ditch‚Äù than ask for a Brexit delay from the EU" and then the prevailing 
narrative is a no-deal Brexit is the most likely outcome. 

Papic counters this "preference" driven approach with his constraint-based framework. 
He argues that all political leaders are subject to practical constraints that supersede their
preferences. The preferences are subject to these constraints, but the constraints
are not subject to the actor's preferences, so when the constraints clash with preferences,
you should bet on the constraints.

He then goes on to identify 5 distinct constraints:
1. The political environment
2. Current economic conditions
3. Geopolitical realities
4. Constitutional and legal
5. Time 

Papic describes these constraints in detail and provides several backward looking examples to bolster
his claim. 

The arguments Papic seem sound enough to almost be banal -- of course political leaders are subject to constraints
that should be analyzed instead of just their stated preferences. The point of contention is what those constraints
are and when they clash with preferences. Papic's work is full of backward looking stories carefully curated to
fit his specifically chosen constraints, but is lacking any explicit forward-looking forecasts. Additionally,
there is no back-testing of this framework to test across environments. 

Rating: 4/5

Although Papic makes few explicit predictions and his arguments seem riddled with hindsight
bias, this book got me thinking about how to best incorporate geopolitical information
into an investing framework. And there aren't many other books that tackle this topic.
