This blog post details the creation and architecture of my book recommendation
site [SmartBookFinder](smartbookfinder.com)

# The Motivation

I love reading, and one of the most exciting moments for me is finishing a book and deciding what to read next. 
However, I’ve struggled to find a recommendation platform that truly understands my preferences.

I primarily use Goodreads to keep track of the books I have read, my ratings, and
my want to read list, but I have found their book recommendations to be underwhelming.

Since I had been using ChatGPT so much recently, and it had built up a large repository
of memories and background on my projects, interests, and goals, I thought that 
asking ChatGPT for recommendations would be a good idea. 

ChatGPT gave me a great response not only listing books that sounded intriguing
but including a custom reason why it recommended each book personalized for me. This was
already significantly better than any other book recommendation I had seen before. I
started using ChatGPT for this purpose before deciding on every book. I didn't always
go with the book Chatgpt recommended, but it provided a good source to learn about books
that I otherwise would never have heard about.

Since I was using Chatgpt so much for this purpose, I wanted to streamline the 
process and make it available to others. I set out to create a basic chatgpt
wrapper. This resulted in a single page where users would fill out some basic information
and a wall of text would be output, hopefully, with some book titles.

I enjoyed this process so much that I just kept adding features. The rest of
this post details building those features along with my future plans for the 
site.

# The Book Recommendations

This is the bread and butter of the site -- the whole reason I initially 
created it. Over time, the book recommendations have grown to live in multiple
places each with slightly different purpose or methodology for how books
are recommended.

## Reader Profile

The reader profile was the initial scope of SmartBookFinder. This is a section
where users enter some data points about their personality and reading 
habits. 

![Reader Profile Input Form](/assets/smartbookfinder/reader_profile.webp)

I then extract this input and put it into a standardized json message that can 
be sent to the ChatGPT API along with a prompt specifying the following:

```json
You are an assistant generating personalized reader profiles based on user inputs. Analyze the given responses and create a **reader personality type** tailored to the user. Return the results in the following structured JSON format:
    {
     "personality_type": "<Name of the reader personality type (e.g., 'The Analytical Explorer')>",
     "description": "<A brief description of this reader personality type, focusing on their reading habits, preferences, and motivations.>",
     "traits": [
         "<Trait 1 (e.g., Analytical)>",
         "<Trait 2 (e.g., Curious)>",
         "<Trait 3 (e.g., Reflective)>",
         "<Trait 4 (e.g., Adventurous)>",
         "<Trait 5 (e.g., Thoughtful)>"
          ], 
     "suggested_books": [
         {
            "title": "<Book Title 1>",
            "author": "<Author Name 1>",
            "description": "<Why this book is recommended for this reader personality type.>",
            "reason": "<Why this book is recommended for this reader personality type.>"
            },
               ...
```

I came to this format after a long time requesting the results as normal text
and trying to parse the results. Receiving the results as structured json
allows me to more easily parse different sections of the results.

## Free form

I needed a way to search for books without altering my full reader profile. If one day I wanted books about the 
French Revolution, I didn’t want that preference to permanently affect all my future recommendations. To solve this, 
I built a simpler, one-time-use search tool, which became SmartBookFinder's homepage 
because it:
1. Had a lower barrier to entry than the reader profile
2. Was more flexible than the reader profile

![SmartBookFinder Homepage](/assets/smartbookfinder/smartbookfinder_homepage.webp)

This is a simple flow that prompts the user for any kind of book preference.
This prompt is then sent to the chatgpt API. Similarly to the reader profile
section, the results are returned in json. 

For each book returned , we can query the relevant metadata to construct
the book card. This metadata includes things like the book thumbnail, description,
and amazon link.

# **Login Functionality**  

The initial version of SmartBookFinder didn’t include user accounts. This worked fine for generating book 
recommendations on the fly, but it quickly became clear that users needed a way to **save their reading preferences** 
and track which books they had already read. Without a login system, every visit required users to **re-enter their 
reader profile**, and there was no way to personalize recommendations over time.  

To solve this, I integrated **Flask-Login**, a lightweight authentication library for Flask that handles user session 
management. Flask-Login made it easy to implement features like **persistent user sessions**, so readers can log in 
and have their preferences, past recommendations, and "want to read" lists stored. It also enabled **personalized book 
recommendations** by remembering which books a user has already read, helping to refine future suggestions.  

By adding login functionality, SmartBookFinder became a **more personalized and interactive experience**, allowing 
users to build their own evolving reading profiles rather than starting from scratch each visit.

# Database

This login functionality meant a database was now required to persist user
data across sessions. 

## User

The first thing I needed to do was create a user table along with a 
corresponding user class. This is what is created when a user actually
registers for an account on SmartBookFinder. To ensure security, I store the
password hash and don't persist the actual password anywhere.

We extend flask-login's default UserMixin class which provides some common 
authentication related methods. From there, we set up the logic to create 
the password hash and implement logic to check the password when a user 
attempts to login.


```python
class User(UserMixin, db.Model):
    __tablename__ = 'user'
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    username = db.Column(db.String(150), unique=True, nullable=False)
    email = db.Column(db.String(150), unique=True, nullable=False)
    password_hash = db.Column(db.String(200), nullable=False)
    read_books = db.relationship('UserBook', back_populates='user')  


    def set_password(self, password):
        from werkzeug.security import generate_password_hash
        self.password_hash = generate_password_hash(password, method='pbkdf2:sha256')

    def check_password(self, password):
        from werkzeug.security import check_password_hash
        return check_password_hash(self.password_hash, password)
```

`read_books` establishes a relationship with a separate table called user_books
that stores books for each user that they want to read, have already read,
or are recommended for them. 

## User_books

`read_books = db.relationship('UserBook', back_populates='user') ` establishes
this relationship. It then checks user_books for any foreign key referencing
the user table. In this case, user_books has a foreign key on `user_id`, so
it knows that this is the join path.

```python
class UserBook(db.Model):
    __tablename__ = 'user_books'
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    user_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('user.id'), nullable=False)
    book_isbn = db.Column(db.String(13), db.ForeignKey('book.isbn'), nullable=False)
    rating = db.Column(db.String(13), nullable=True)
    status = db.Column(db.String(20), nullable=False, default="want_to_read")
    timestamp = db.Column(db.DateTime, default=db.func.current_timestamp())
    user = db.relationship('User', back_populates='read_books')
    book = db.relationship('Book', back_populates='read_by_users')
```

## Books

Since we now have a database, it makes sense to store **book metadata locally** rather than relying on API calls for every request.

#### **Advantages of storing book metadata:**
- **Faster page loading** – Data retrieval is quicker than making external API calls.
- **Reduced reliance on third-party APIs** – Avoids rate limits and potential service disruptions.
- **Better data control** – Enables more advanced querying, recommendations, and analytics.

#### **Key Features:**
- **ISBN as Primary Key** – Ensures uniqueness for each book.
- **Title & Author** – Essential metadata for display and searching.
- **Description** – Stores book summaries for a richer user experience.
- **Published Date** – Helps users find books based on release year.
- **Page Count** – Provides additional metadata for users looking at book length.
- **Thumbnail** – Stores cover image URLs for a more visually engaging UI.
- **Categories** – Allows for book organization and filtering.
- **User Relationship** – Links to user interactions, tracking books read, rated, or added to wishlists.

By storing book metadata, SmartBookFinder can **improve performance**, **enhance personalization**, and **expand functionality** in future updates.


## Site Architecture

SmartBookFinder is designed with a **simple yet scalable architecture**, ensuring fast performance, easy maintainability, and flexibility for future enhancements.

### **Technology Stack**
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Jinja templating for dynamic content)
- **Backend:** Flask (Python)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (Hosted via Render)
- **Hosting & Deployment:** Render (Handles both the web app and database)
- **Caching & Performance:** Future plans to integrate Redis or a CDN for speed improvements

### **Request Flow**
1. **User Requests a Page**  
   - Requests are routed through `app.py`, which determines the appropriate response.
   - Pages are rendered using **Flask templates** (Jinja2).

2. **Database Queries**  
   - Book information and user interactions are stored in **PostgreSQL**.
   - Queries are managed using **SQLAlchemy** for ORM-based interactions.

3. **AI-Powered Book Recommendations**  
   - When a user searches for books, the backend:
     - Processes input
     - Calls OpenAI to generate personalized recommendations
     - Fetches metadata from **Google Books API**
     - Stores book data in the database for caching and future searches

4. **User Data & Authentication**  
   - Users can log in, track books, and save preferences.
   - Authentication is handled with **Flask-Login** and password hashing.

    
## Hosting

Choosing the right hosting solution has always been a challenge for me. It often feels like a tradeoff between **costly but simple** options and **cheap but complex** setups.

After researching various platforms, I decided to go with [Render](https://render.com/). The main reason for this choice was **ease of deployment**—Render provided the simplest way to get my Slack app up and running, and I was able to do this under their **free tier**.

![Render Hosting Pricing](/assets/smartbookfinder/render_pricing.webp)

### **The Tradeoff: Free Tier Limitations**
The free tier on Render does come with a notable downside: **instances spin down after periods of inactivity**. This means that if no one visits the site for a while, the next request can take up to a minute to load while the server starts back up.

### **Keeping My Site Always Online (For Free)**
Since I prefer to keep costs low while avoiding long startup delays, I found a simple workaround—using a **free uptime monitoring service** like [UptimeRobot](https://uptimerobot.com/). By setting up a ping every 15 minutes, I prevent my instance from ever going idle, keeping response times fast while still benefiting from Render’s free tier.

This setup strikes the right balance between affordability and performance, making Render a great choice for hosting SmartBookFinder.

## Analytics

I am using Google Analytics to handle analytics. This just required adding a 
JavaScript snippet to my `base.html` page. This provides an easy way to 
monitor key metrics like:

### **Traffic & User Behavior**
- **Pageviews**: Tracks how many times pages are visited.
- **Unique Visitors**: Helps understand how many distinct users are engaging with SmartBookFinder.
- **Session Duration**: Measures how long users stay on the site, indicating engagement levels.
- **Bounce Rate**: Tracks the percentage of visitors who leave after viewing only one page.

### **Acquisition & Sources**
- **Organic Search Traffic**: Monitors how many users find SmartBookFinder through Google and other search engines.
- **Referral Traffic**: Tracks visitors coming from external links, like blogs, social media, or book forums.
- **Social Media Traffic**: Analyzes the impact of Twitter, Instagram, and other social platforms on visitor flow.
- **Direct Traffic**: Shows how many users type the URL directly into their browser.

### **User Engagement**
- **Click Tracking**: Measures interactions like book recommendations clicked, searches performed, and external links followed.
- **Conversion Rate**: Tracks how many users mark books as "Want to Read" or interact with recommendations.
- **Heatmaps & Scroll Depth**: (Planned) Use additional tools like Hotjar to analyze how users navigate the site.

### **SEO Performance**
- **Top Landing Pages**: Identifies which blog posts or book recommendation pages attract the most traffic.
- **Keyword Performance**: Uses Google Search Console to analyze which search terms drive visitors to the site.
- **Exit Pages**: Helps determine where users are dropping off and how to improve retention.

### **A/B Testing & Optimization**
- **Experimenting with Titles & Descriptions**: Testing different blog post titles to see what attracts more clicks.
- **Navigation Tweaks**: Measuring how changes to menus and internal links affect engagement.
- **Call-to-Action (CTA) Performance**: Testing different CTA placements to encourage book interactions.

# Lessons Learned

### Marketing is the most important thing

I've spent a lot of time on this project. It was a great learning opportunity,
but I'd be lying if I said I don't get excited everytime a new user visits 
the site. For this, I need marketing, and it's very difficult to stand out.

During development, I decided to take a look at other websites with similar
functionality. There are a bunch. Many of these competitors look great and 
feel great. [MeetNewBooks](https://www.meetnewbooks.com/), for example, is 
one of my favorites. To compete with them, I need SmartBookFinder to be seen.

### User-Friendly is more important than technically ideal

My first iteration of SmartBookFinder had individual book pages with the following
url structure, `www.smartbookfinder.com/book/<isbn>`. I thought this was a great
approach because each book would have a unique isbn, so there would be no risk
of books with the same title having conflicting URLs. 

Unfortunately, I quickly noticed a much lower CTR for book pages than other pages.
I believe this was due to the non-user-friendly, and almost suspicous-looking,
urls consisting of only a number.

Recently, I have changed the url to `www.smartbookfinder.com/book/<book-title>-<isbn>`
to more accurately reflect what is on a given page in google search results. We will
see if this improves click through rates.

### UI is much more difficult than I thought

I thought the UI and layout of pages would be an afterthought -- I was dead wrong.
This has taken up the majority of my time. Everytime I modify the size of a
component on one page, it seems to break 5 other components on some different page.

I have started being more specific with my CSS component naming. Instead of a
generic `class=container`, I will do something like `class=reader-profile-page-container`.
That way I have more control over changing the look of just a single page instead
of dealing with unforeseen consequences reverberating across my entire site after
every edit.

# Next Steps

## Lean more into marketing

As I mentioned above, marketing is everything, and I want to see how far I can
take SmartBookFinder. For this, I plan on focusing on

1. **Social Media Marketing**: I have created an Instagram account and plan to start posting
2. **Reddit**: I have also created a [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/SmartBookFinder/) that I want to start a community on
3. **Improve SEO**: This is a constant struggle that I enjoy working on. I want to continue blog posts and optimizing on page and technical SEO

## Build out additional functionality

Building out additional functionality helps me provide more value to users,
flex my technical chops, and it's fun.

#### Integrating with Overdrive

This is my white whale. [Overdrive](https://www.overdrive.com/) is a platform
that links with library accounts across the country to access free digital
book rentals. My main goal is to allow users to sign up on SmartBookFinder and
select their library. Then, I can use Overdrive's API to show the Overdrive
status for each book at the user's specified library. I am currently applying
for Overdrive API access.

#### Support synchronous book clubs

I think this would be a differentiator from many other platforms available today.
I'm envisioning a community of book-lovers who can engage in live virtual book discussions.
This requires a critical mass to work, so I plan on creating a waitlist until we reach
a number of interested users that will make this possible.
