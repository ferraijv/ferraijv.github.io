I have been imagining creating a blog for probably a 
decade now and have looked into multiple times without 
ever pulling the trigger for several reasons:

1. I didn't think I had anything special to say
2. I thought I lacked the discipline to regularly post to the site
3. I didn't want to pay the $5/year to host a site

Well, now I'm finally doing it, so what changed?

1. I still don't think I have anything special to say, but now I'm using this blog to organize my thoughts
2. I still might lack the discipline to continue? We will see
3. I found out that I can host for free with Github pages

I've done a lot of random projects scattered across
the internet over the past 15 years. I have a tendency 
to get strongly interested in one topic and dive head first into it. 
Then, I forget about it and never touch it again. 

I don't think this is inherently negative, but I want to start tackling projects
where a short time-investment can yield results. I want this blog to serve as a 
consolidation of all of these projects, so they aren't lost forever once I move on.
