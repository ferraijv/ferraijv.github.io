I've been inspired by [Marginal Revolution](https://marginalrevolution.com/) to copy
their post format of sharing a collection of links with a brief blurb for each. This allows
me to share what I've been reading and thinking about recently.

- [Cities eliminating an option for low-cost housing](https://www.pew.org/en/research-and-analysis/issue-briefs/2025/07/how-states-and-cities-decimated-americans-lowest-cost-housing-option)

> An example of well-intentioned policy -- increasing the quality of lodging -- causing adverse downstream impact in the form
> of increased housing costs and homelessness

- [Why aren't Markets Freaking out?](https://paulkrugman.substack.com/p/why-arent-markets-freaking-out)

> Krugman claims the market regularly misprices the risk of crises. He is claiming
> the market is mispricing the risk of the Fed losing independence and the resulting 
> inflation. It's easy to make these claims, but another thing to actually have skin 
> the game; however, assuming Krugman is right about this mispricing, what would be a profitable trade?

> My immediate thoughts are you could purchase other more inflation-resistant currencies. 
> The Bitcoin crowd would suggest Bitcoin is a great store of value not susceptible
> to debasement, but this has yet to be seen. Any kind of leveraged approach to purchasing
> commodities or commodity related companies should provide upside assuming we 
> actually do get inflation

- [Emotional Intelligence Benchmark for LLMs](https://eqbench.com/spiral-bench.html)

> This is an interesting approach that seems timely with recent headlines about LLMs 
> encouraging delusions in people. However, I do have concerns about LLMs -- and the underlying
> companies -- becoming the arbiters of truths
