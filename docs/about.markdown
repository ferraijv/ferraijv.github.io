# About
Hello, my name is Jacob Ferraiolo. I am a senior data engineer currently living in Dallas, TX.
I have worked as an analyst, data scientist, and now data engineer. I am interested 
in Finance, Data Engineering/Science, and various other topics at any given time.
I decided to create this blog because I want to consolidate all the projects I 
work on and as well as provide a platform to organize my thoughts.

# Who am I?

My first job was a pricing analyst at a small auto insurance company. Fortunately,
part of this job's training program was a brief stint in their MIS (management
information systems) department. This gave me a chance to learn all about
data engineering. I wrote my first lines of SQL, learned about data modeling,
and worked with analysts to figure out how to use data to solve business
problems.

Ever since that first job, I was hooked on using data to solve problems.
From there, I worked as a data scientist for a few years before realizing
that I needed to learn more engineering to be effective. So, I pivoted to
data engineering and have been doing it ever since.

This experience ranging from analytics to engineering has given me a broad
view of the data landscape. My goal with this blog is primarily
to organize my thoughts and projects. They say writing is the best way
to structure your thoughts, and that's what I hope to do here.
