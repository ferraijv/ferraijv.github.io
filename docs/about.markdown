Hello, I’m **Jacob Ferraiolo**, a **Senior Data Engineer** based in **Dallas, TX**, with a background spanning **data engineering, data science, and machine learning**.

## My Journey
My career began as a **pricing analyst** at an auto insurance company, where I was first introduced to SQL, data modeling, and the power of data-driven decision-making. That experience sparked my interest in data science and machine learning, leading me to roles where I built recommendation systems, predictive models, and real-time data pipelines.
