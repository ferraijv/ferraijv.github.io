Hello, Iâ€™m **Jacob Ferraiolo**, a **Senior Data Engineer** based in **Dallas, TX**, with a background spanning **data engineering, data science, and machine learning**. I specialize in building scalable data pipelines, optimizing data infrastructure, and applying predictive modeling to solve business problems.

I created this blog as a **space to document my projects, explore new ideas, and refine my thinking**. Whether itâ€™s algorithmic trading, AI-driven recommendations, or building efficient ETL pipelines, I enjoy working on **technical challenges that intersect with business impact**.

## My Journey
My career began as a **pricing analyst** at an auto insurance company, where I was first introduced to SQL, data modeling, and the power of data-driven decision-making. That experience sparked my interest in data science and machine learning, leading me to roles where I built recommendation systems, predictive models, and real-time data pipelines.

But beyond my day job, I love tackling **side projects** that combine **finance, data science, and automation**â€”from **building a TSA traffic prediction bot for trading** to **creating a book recommendation system**.
